My research interests are the intersection of Computer Vision, Audiovisual representation learning, and robust solutions in Machine Learning. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also an avid reader, learner and writer, love sharing my experiences in personal development. Also a sports enthusiast, enjoy playing badminton, ping pong, gym and occassionally swimming.
