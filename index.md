Currently working in Computer Vision, Audiovisual representation learning, and Robustness, I am passionate about creating useful solutions using machine learning. 

I program mostly in TensorFlow. Can work in PyTorch and Jax as well.

Other than work, I love to [read](./readings), enjoy playing badminton {You'll enjoy playing singles with me:)} & ping pong.
