Hey,

I am a PhD Computer Science student interested in Multimodal Representation Learning, Computer Vision and Model Robustness. 

I love programming, reading, exploring stuff, working out and writing.

Right now, I am learning how to do  :butterfly: butterfly swimming. Consider myself an average :swimming_man:	freestyle swimmer.
