Welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student, research assistant, and a software developer with a passion for open-source technology. My research interests are the intersection of Computer Vision, Audiovisual representation learning, and robust solutions in Machine Learning.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also an avid reader, learner and writer, sharing my experiences on Personal development. I am also a sports enthusiast and enjoy playing badminton, ping pong, going to the gym and occassionally swimming. My website serves as a platform to share my knowledge, research, and personal interests with others. I hope you will find it informative and valuable. 

Thank you for visiting!
