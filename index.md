I fell in love with programming in 6th grade when I learned that my friend could develop the games I played on my PC. I attempted to create a Visual Basic application in high school, but it was unsuccessful. My passion for programming persisted, even after graduating with a mechanical engineering degree. I adore reading, writing, thinking about, improving, and understanding programs, especially in Python. 

I am proficient in TensorFlow \(flexible to work with PyTorch, and Jax\), and I am passionate about creating useful solutions using machine learning.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading üìö, playing badminton üè∏ and ping pong üèì, and learning new things üß†.

**Publications**

* **May 2023:** [HolisticDFD: Spatiotemporal Transformer Embeddings Infusion for Deepfake Detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025523009374) (Information Sciences)
* **April 2023:** [Multimodaltrace: Deepfake Detection using Audiovisual Representation Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023W/WMF/html/Raza_Multimodaltrace_Deepfake_Detection_Using_Audiovisual_Representation_Learning_CVPRW_2023_paper.html) (CVPR 2023 Workshop on Media Forensics)

**Projects**

* **Keras Core:** Open-source contributions include implementing cross-backend patch extraction for vision transformer-like models and porting examples to Keras Core ([merged pull requests](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Aanas-rz)).
* **Deep Forgery Detector:** Designed and developed Deep Forgery Detector, an extensible framework for deploying visual deepfake detection algorithms (work done at SMILES Lab @ Oakland University).
* **Forensic Examiner:** Designed and developed Forensic Examiner, an extensible framework for benchmarking and evaluating audio spoofing detection algorithms (work done at SMILES Lab @ Oakland University).
* **FocalNet TensorFlow:** Implemented and ported weights for Focal Modulation Network in TensorFlow/Keras ([link](https://github.com/anas-rz/focalnet-tensorflow)).
* **StorySeed:** Developed StorySeed, a Hugging Face Space that generates story ideas from images ([HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/anasrz/StorySeed)).
* **Evaluating Modern Vision Architectures on 3D Biomedical Data:** Published a Colab notebook and Google Slides presentation that compare the performance of different vision architectures on 3D biomedical data ([Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nz-NtGxC3NeSJh4ZWQ8jabzBlawnvIWe?usp=sharing), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o1SD0WHBJEqvjOIJWys-Y6z80uuiejmC/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118316226676823953327&rtpof=true&sd=true)).
* **Oil Debris Monitoring System using deep learning:** Led a team of five members to fabricate an oil debris monitoring sensor that employed time-series anomaly detection techniques to report anomalous patterns in lubricants. The project has its significance in preventive maintenance for moving mechanical systems (work done at UET Taxila).

**Updates**

* **October 15, 2022:** Spoke at UET Taxila on "An Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers." ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HIWUd9OQaHk1D1ESe77uEcZ6ir7DKLdQIj3rKms_yPs/edit?usp=sharing))
