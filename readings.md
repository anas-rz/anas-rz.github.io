## Book Reviews

I've loved reading since primary school, starting with Hamdard Naunehal and Phool, and progressing to Naseem Hijazi novels, history, humor, personal development, and tech. I was once addicted to reading newspapers cover to cover daily. My reading habit enriches my life and aids my research in all fields.

* **Win Every Argument** by Mehdi Hasan: Mehdi Hasan's passionate and engaging style, along with his wonderful rhetorical tools, make this book a must-read for anyone who wants to have more effective debates and conversations. 

* **Ego is the Enemy** by Ryan Holiday: This book teaches you how to overcome your ego and live a more fulfilling life, arguing that it is the biggest obstacle at all stages of life whether you are aiming, succeeding, or failing. Holiday provides practical advice on how to identify and tame our egos so that we can focus on what's truly important, such as our relationships, our values, and our contributions to the world.

* **Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life** This book explores the Japanese concept of ikigai, often translated as "reason for being" or "life purpose." The book focuses rather on the materialistic purpose one can perceive.

* **The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business** by Charles Duhigg is a longer book that I read a few years ago, but it has had a lasting impact on my understanding of how habits work and how to change them. Whether you are looking to evade bad habits or develop good ones, this book is a must.

## All-Time Favorites

* **The Compound Effect** by Darren Hardy: This book teaches you the power of small, consistent actions over time, showing how even the smallest changes can have a profound impact on your life if you stick with them long enough. 

* **Aab e Gum** by Mushtaq Ahmad Yusufi: In this timeless classic, Yusufi shares humourous stories of his friends, using a unique blend of satire and nostalgia. Aab e Gum is a must-read for anyone who loves to laugh.

* **Khumaar e Gandum** by Ibn e Insha: A collection of humourous essays, the first one being praised by all humourists across the country. Khumar e Gandum is another must-read for fans of Urdu humor, and it features some of the most iconic and quotable lines in Urdu literature.

* **Three Men in a Boat** by Jerome K. Jerome: This hilarious and heartwarming novel about three friends on a boating trip along the River Thames is full of wit and charm. Three Men in a Boat is a classic British novel that has been enjoyed by readers of all ages for generations.
