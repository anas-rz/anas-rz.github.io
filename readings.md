## Book Reviews \{OPINIONS\}
- **Win Every Argument** by Mehdi Hasan:
  - I love Mehdi Hasan's style on Al Jazeera and beyond. The book gives wonderful rhetorical tools. I love watching all kinds of debates and this book gives a very different perspective to observe and have these discussions.
- **The Great Mental Models**:
  - “In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins.”
Excerpt From: Shane Parrish. “The Great Mental Models: General Thinking Concepts.” Apple Books.   
- **Ego is the enemy**
  - Best book to read. The kind of book you want to go back to again and again. Our ego stops us from progressing at all stages. Whether we are aiming to do something good, we have achieved something or we are failing. It is the biggest enemy living inside us.
- **Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life** (Read *May 2023*)
  - Short book. An amalgam of different self-help ideas like Flow. Very little information about the actual title ikigai more about how and examples. 

## All-Time Favourites (I want to read again and again):

- **The Compound Effect** by _Darren Hardy_

I love reading humour and \{try to\} write too. You can access a few pieces [here](https://www.facebook.com/anaswriting/).

- **Aab e Gum** by _Mushtaq Ahmad Yusufi_.
- **Khumaar e Gandum** by _Ibn e Insha_.
- **Three Men in  a Boat** by _Jerome K. Jerome_.
